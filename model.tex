the central differences approximation.}

\begin{abstract}
  In order to simulate the trajectories of celestial bodies,
  we want a numerical solution to the n-body problem created
  by the modeling of the gravitational interactions between each body.

  We want to be able to simulate these trajectories for a space scale
  with the same order of magnitude as the solar system, and a time scale
  varying from a few days to a few years.

  We use a simple finite difference method on a discrete time scale
  to approximate the second order derivative component in the formulation
  of Newton's second law. No consideration has been given to the collision case.

  Instead of focusing on precision or accuracy, the main goal of the
  study is the ease of implementation. Therefore we only study here the
  stability and convergence of the solution.
